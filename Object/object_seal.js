With sealing, the situation is a little bit different, The Object.seal() method seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to the object. It does the following things:
1.Allows changing existed properties of an object
2. Prevents adding new properties
3. Donâ€™t allow remove existing properties

Object.isSealed(obj); // true

obj.lastname='xyz'; // will not add new property.
delete obj.name // false
